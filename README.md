The UI is purely based on Next.JS
I have not used the smartphone png instead used a dummy smartphone cutout from the given UI image itself.
Moreover, the given UI used Icons(under "How it works ?" section), which I have replaced with a dummy button depicting the icon space as I didn't had those icons.

To achieve exact UI, I would have to use Icons & the used smartphone png with a groovy effect that can be achieved using third-party tools(figma, canva, photoshop).
